## english_corpus.txt

This file contains ordered stems from the https://www.corpusdata.org/formats.asp NOW dataset Word/lemma/PoS *sample*. This is 5% of the dataset, but is probably representative of relative frequencies should be good enough for our use case.

The file is formatted as just stems on individual lines ordered by occurrence descending. An approximation of relative frequency can be reconstructed with 1/n where n is the line number. In other words, this file contains the most frequently used words in the english language in descending order.

## stop_words.txt

This file contains full words that should be excluded from the analysis.
